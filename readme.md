## Timed JavaScript Quiz
The main goal of the project is to create a timed quiz that displays questions, checks whether the user selected the right answer, and displays the user score and other high scores in the hall of fame.  

## Description 
This is a 60 second timed JavaScript quiz that displays a question once the start quiz button is pressed. Once an answer is selected, another question should appear as well as an indication if the user got the question correct or wrong. If a question is answered incorrectly, then a penalty of 10 seconds is applied to the time. The quiz will end once the user either answers all the questions or if the time runs out and the final score will appear. The user can enter their initials and see where they rank in the hall of fame.
